# Welcome

This github is for my Senior Capstone Project. It is currently unorganized and unformatted.

The demonstrated file at the Incoming Freshmen Night is Video.py, some controller stuff is commented out.

The main file is main.py, but it is not up to date. I haven't pushed in a minute due to business with other projects, thanks!

I haven't committed / gone in and fixed all the files as of recent. So beware of issues.
